# Atomic Team Design Primer

_A conceptual guide to designing organisations around capability, not hierarchy_

## Introduction

Most organisations are designed using structures that are easy to draw, not structures that reflect how work actually happens.

Org charts show reporting lines. Job titles describe intent. Headcount implies capacity.
None of these reliably explain what an organisation is capable of delivering or why it struggles when change arrives.

Atomic Team Design is a way of thinking about organisations through the lens of capability. It provides a shared language and mental model for reasoning about how skills combine, how teams form, and how organisations evolve over time.

This primer introduces that lens.

## What Atomic Team Design Is (and Is Not)

Atomic Team Design is a design framework.

It helps leaders reason about organisational structure, capability, and evolution in a deliberate way. It is intended to support decision-making, not replace it.

Atomic Team Design is not:

- A prescriptive org model
- A set of standard team types
- A replacement for existing delivery or planning frameworks
- A taxonomy of roles or skills

Two organisations using Atomic Team Design should not look the same.

## The Atomic Lens

Atomic Team Design borrows its structure from the natural sciences, not as a metaphor for its own sake, but because it provides a useful abstraction for complex systems.

### Atoms - Capabilities

An Atom represents a single capability: a skill, competency, or area of expertise that contributes to meaningful work.

Examples include:

- A programming language
- A design discipline
- A domain capability
- An operational or regulatory skill

Atoms are the smallest unit ATD concerns itself with. Without understanding the atoms you possess, and the atoms you require, organisational design becomes guesswork.

### Molecules - Compositions of Capability

A Molecule is a composition of atoms bonded together to form something more complex.

In Atomic Team Design, molecules commonly represent:

- People - a unique combination of skills, experience, and traits
- Roles or vacancies - an intended composition of capability
- Services, products, or systems - which require certain capabilities to operate safely and effectively

Unlike real molecules, organisational molecules are not static. People learn. Roles evolve. Systems change. Molecules can gain atoms, lose atoms, or become unstable over time.

### Cells - Teams

A Cell represents a team.

Each cell exists to perform a specific function within the organisation. That function defines the capabilities the cell requires, which in turn defines the molecules that belong within it.

In Atomic Team Design:

- Teams are designed from purpose
- Capability requirements flow into the team, not outward from job titles
- Team composition is expected to evolve as demand changes

If a team feels ineffective despite "having the right people", the issue is often structural rather than individual.

### Organisms - Organisations

The Organism is the organisation as a whole.

It is not simply the sum of its teams, but the product of:

- How capabilities are distributed
- How teams interact
- How systems support or constrain work
- How the organisation adapts over time

Healthy organisms evolve through recomposition, changing capability and structure incrementally, rather than constant large-scale reorganisation.

### Subatomic Particles - What Makes Capability Work

Capabilities are not binary. Two people may share the same skill on paper but differ dramatically in effectiveness.

Atomic Team Design accounts for this through subatomic particles - the components that influence how an atom behaves in practice.

At a high level, these include:

- Foundational traits: _Enduring characteristics that influence how skills are learned and applied (for example: problem-solving, empathy, adaptability)._
- Learned skills: _Knowledge and techniques acquired through education and experience._
- Proficiency: _The depth and reliability with which a capability can be exercised._

These factors affect:

- How quickly capability can grow
- How safely it can be relied upon
- How resilient a team is under pressure

### What Changes When You Use This Lens

Viewing an organisation through the atomic lens changes the questions leaders ask.

Instead of:

- "Do we have enough people?"
- "Do we need to reorganise?"
- "Who should own this?"

You begin to ask:

- "What capabilities does this outcome require?"
- "Where is capability concentrated or fragile?"
- "What breaks if demand shifts?"
- "Should this be solved by hiring, learning, redesign or automation?"

This shift makes structural problems visible earlier and reduces the need for reactive reorganisation.

## Humans, Automation, and AI

Atomic Team Design is deliberately neutral about who provides capability.

A capability may be delivered by:

- A human
- An automated system
- An AI-assisted agent
- Or a hybrid of all three

The framework allows leaders to reason about:

- Where automation safely augments teams
- Where autonomy introduces unacceptable risk
- Which capabilities require human judgement or empathy
- How responsibility and oversight should be designed

By treating AI as a capability rather than a solution, Atomic Team Design helps organisations adopt it intentionally not opportunistically.

## What Comes Next

- Mapping capability to outcomes
- Identifying structural risk

- Worked examples from real organisations

Atomic Team Design does not promise simple answers.

It offers something more useful:
