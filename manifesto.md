# Manifesto

### 1. Organisations are living systems, not machines

_They grow, adapt, decay, and respond to their environment. Designing them as static hierarchies guarantees fragility._

### 2. Org charts describe reporting lines, not capability

_They tell you who manages whom, not what your organisation is actually able to do._

### 3. Capability is the fundamental unit of organisational design

_Skills, knowledge, and traits, not roles or titles, determine what an organisation can deliver._

### 4. Teams should be designed from outcomes, not headcount

_The purpose of a team defines its required capabilities. People should be assembled to meet that purpose - not the other way around._

### 5. Individuals are molecules, not interchangeable parts

_Each person is a unique composition of skills, experience, and potential. Treating people as fungible resources destroys effectiveness._

### 6. Teams are cells with specific functions

_A team’s structure, composition, and boundaries should be shaped by the function it performs within the wider organism._

### 7. Organisations evolve through recomposition, not reorganisation

_Most change should come from evolving capability and composition, not constant structural upheaval._

### 8. Design precedes hiring

_Hiring without understanding the capabilities you need is guesswork, not strategy._

### 9. Constraints matter as much as ambition

_Regulation, risk, cognitive load, and system limits must shape how teams are designed._

### 10. Atomic Team Design is a design framework, not a taxonomy

_It does not prescribe fixed roles, team types, or structures. It provides a way to reason, model, and intentionally design organisations that fit their context._

### 11. Atomic Team Design is a design exercise, not an optimisation exercise

_Before optimising for efficiency, utilisation, or velocity, organisations must first design for purpose, constraints, and resilience. Optimisation without design entrenches existing dysfunction._
