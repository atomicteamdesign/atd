# Manifesto

Modern organisations are expected to adapt continuously, to new markets, new technologies, new regulations, and new ways of working.

Yet most are still designed using static structures, fixed roles, and assumptions that no longer hold.

Atomic Team Design is a way to reason about organisations as living systems, designed intentionally around capability, constraints, and evolution.

## Principles

### 1. Organisations are living systems, not machines

_They grow, adapt, decay, and respond to their environment. Designing them as static hierarchies guarantees fragility._

### 2. Org charts describe reporting lines, not capability

_They show who manages whom, not what the organisation is actually able to do._

### 3. Capability is the fundamental unit of organisational design

_Skills, knowledge, experience, and traits - not roles or titles - determine what an organisation can deliver._

### 4. Teams should be designed from outcomes, not headcount

_The purpose of a team defines its required capabilities. People should be assembled to meet that purpose - not retrofitted into it._

### 5. Individuals are molecules, not interchangeable parts

_Each person is a unique composition of skills, experience, and potential. Treating people as fungible resources destroys effectiveness._

### 6. Teams are cells with specific functions

_A team’s structure, composition, and boundaries should be shaped by the function it performs within the wider organism._

### 7. Organisations evolve through recomposition, not reorganisation

_Most change should come from evolving capability and team composition, not constant structural upheaval._

### 8. Design precedes hiring

_Hiring without understanding the capabilities required is guesswork, not strategy._

### 9. Constraints matter as much as ambition

_Regulation, risk, cognitive load, and system limits must actively shape how teams are designed._

### 10. Atomic Team Design is a design framework, not a taxonomy

_It does not prescribe fixed roles, team types, or structures. It provides a way to reason about, model, and intentionally design organisations that fit their context._

### 11. Atomic Team Design is a design exercise, not an optimisation exercise

_Optimising for efficiency, utilisation, or velocity without first designing for purpose, constraints, and resilience entrenches existing dysfunction._

Atomic Team Design does not aim to standardise organisations.

If two organisations applying Atomic Team Design end up looking the same, one of them has done it wrong.

The goal is not conformity, but coherence — an organisation whose structure, capabilities, and systems are deliberately designed to evolve together.
