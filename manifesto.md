# Manifesto

Most organisations are designed around org charts, job titles, and headcount. These things are easy to draw but they don't tell you what your organisation can actually do.

Atomic Team Design is a way of thinking about organisations through capability. It helps you reason about what you have, what you need, and where the gaps are.

## Six Principles

### 1. Capability is the fundamental unit

Skills, knowledge, and experience determine what an organisation can deliver. Not roles. Not titles. Not headcount.

Two people with the same job title might share almost no useful capabilities. Two people with different titles might be nearly interchangeable. Org charts hide this. Capability mapping exposes it.

### 2. Teams exist to serve a purpose

A team's function defines what capabilities it needs. People should be assembled to meet that purpose, not retrofitted into roles that existed before the work did.

If a team has "the right people" but still can't deliver, the problem is usually structural, not individual.

### 3. People are not interchangeable

Each person is a unique combination of skills, experience, depth, and potential. Treating people as fungible resources - "we need three more engineers" - destroys effectiveness and burns trust.

### 4. Design before you hire

Hiring without understanding the capabilities you actually need is guesswork. Define the gap first. Then decide whether to hire, train, restructure, or automate.

### 5. Change through recomposition, not reorganisation

Most change should come from evolving capability and team composition, not constant structural upheaval. If you're reorganising every year, you're not designing — you're reacting.

### 6. Constraints shape the design

Regulation, cognitive load, system boundaries, risk tolerance — these aren't obstacles to work around. They're inputs that should actively shape how teams are built.

## What This Is Not

Atomic Team Design is not a prescriptive org model. It doesn't give you a set of standard team types to copy.

If two organisations using ATD end up looking the same, one of them has done it wrong.

The goal isn't conformity. It's coherence — an organisation whose structure, capabilities, and systems are deliberately designed to evolve together.
