# Atomic Team Design

A framework for designing organisations around capability, not hierarchy.

---

## The Problem

Most organisations are designed using structures that are easy to draw: org charts, job titles, headcount. None of these reliably explain what an organisation can actually do or why it struggles when things change.

Atomic Team Design is a way of thinking about organisations through the lens of capability. It provides a shared language for reasoning about how skills combine, how teams form, and how organisations evolve.

## The Hierarchy

Atomic Team Design borrows its structure from biology — not as a metaphor for its own sake, but because it provides a useful way to reason about complex systems.

| Level | Concept | What it represents |
|-------|---------|-------------------|
| **Atom** | Capability | A single skill, competency, or area of expertise |
| **Molecule** | Composition | People (who have capabilities) and Services (which require them) |
| **Cell** | Team | A group of people with a shared purpose |
| **Organ** | Department | A collection of teams performing a related function |
| **Organism** | Organisation | The whole system — how it's composed and how it evolves |

Each level builds on the one below. Understanding atoms is prerequisite to understanding molecules. Understanding molecules is prerequisite to designing cells. And so on.

## What Changes

When you view your organisation through this lens, the questions change.

Instead of asking:
- "Do we have enough people?"
- "Who should own this?"
- "Do we need to reorganise?"

You start asking:
- "What capabilities does this outcome require?"
- "Where is capability concentrated or fragile?"
- "Should we hire, train, redesign, or automate?"

This shift makes structural problems visible earlier and reduces the need for reactive reorganisation.

## What This Is Not

ATD is not a prescriptive org model. It doesn't give you a set of standard team types to copy or a taxonomy of roles to adopt.

If two organisations using ATD end up looking the same, one of them has done it wrong.

The goal isn't conformity. It's coherence — an organisation whose structure, capabilities, and systems are deliberately designed to evolve together.

---

## Influences

ATD builds on ideas from:
- **[Team Topologies](https://teamtopologies.com/)** — Team interaction patterns and cognitive load
- **[Atomic Design](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/)** — Compositional hierarchy for design systems

It's intended to complement these frameworks, not replace them. Team Topologies tells you how teams should interact. ATD helps you figure out what those teams should be made of.

## Status

This framework is a work in progress. Feedback, challenges, and contributions are welcome.
