# Organisms

*The organisation as a living system.*

## What Is an Organism?

The organism is the organisation as a whole — the complete system of atoms, molecules, cells, and organs working together.

An organism isn't just the sum of its parts. It's the product of:
- How capability is distributed across the system
- How teams and organs interact
- How information flows and decisions get made
- How the whole thing adapts over time

You can have excellent cells that add up to a dysfunctional organism. And you can have an effective organism despite imperfect cells. The system-level behaviour matters.

## Living Systems, Not Machines

The biological metaphor in ATD is deliberate. Organisations behave more like living systems than machines.

**Machines:**
- Are designed once, then operate as intended
- Fail when components break
- Are repaired by replacing parts with identical parts
- Don't change unless someone changes them

**Living systems:**
- Grow, adapt, and respond to their environment
- Heal and compensate when parts are damaged
- Change their own structure over time
- Die when they stop adapting

Treating an organisation like a machine leads to rigid structures that become brittle under pressure. Treating it like a living system means designing for adaptation, resilience, and evolution.

## How Organisms Evolve

Healthy organisations change through recomposition, not reorganisation.

**Reorganisation:**
- Big-bang structural changes
- Everyone gets new boxes on the org chart
- Disruptive, expensive, often traumatic
- Usually happens every 1-2 years (too infrequent to respond to real change, frequent enough to exhaust everyone)

**Recomposition:**
- Continuous small adjustments to capability and structure
- People move between cells as needs shift
- Cells gain or shed services based on capacity and purpose
- Organ boundaries adjust as business domains evolve

Recomposition is maintenance. Reorganisation is surgery. You should need surgery rarely. You should be maintaining constantly.

ATD provides the language to make recomposition deliberate. When you understand capability at the atom level, you can make small moves with confidence instead of waiting until problems are big enough to justify upheaval.

## Organism-Level Capability Analysis

At the cell level, you ask: "Does this team have what it needs?"

At the organism level, you ask: "Does this organisation have what it needs, and is it distributed sensibly?"

**Distribution questions:**
- Where is critical capability concentrated vs. spread?
- Are there organisation-wide single points of failure?
- Which capabilities exist in silos that should be shared?
- Which capabilities are over-distributed and should be consolidated?

**Balance questions:**
- Are platform/enabling cells adequately supporting stream-aligned cells?
- Is there appropriate capability to handle regulatory and operational demands?
- Are we building capability in areas the business is moving toward?
- Are we holding onto capability in areas we're moving away from?

**Evolution questions:**
- What capabilities are we developing?
- What capabilities are we losing (intentionally or not)?
- How is automation changing our capability needs?
- Are we investing in the atoms that matter for our future, not just our present?

## Organism Health

A healthy organism:
- **Knows what capability it has** — not just what's on paper, but what's actually present
- **Knows what capability it needs** — derived from purpose and services, not inherited from history
- **Understands its gaps and risks** — single points of failure are identified, not hidden
- **Adapts continuously** — small recompositions happen regularly, not rarely
- **Learns and develops** — capability grows deliberately, not accidentally

An unhealthy organism:
- Has capability misaligned with purpose
- Relies on heroics to compensate for structural gaps
- Resists change until change becomes unavoidable
- Loses capability without noticing until it's too late
- Grows through accretion rather than design

## Humans, Automation, and AI

ATD is deliberately neutral about *who* or *what* provides capability.

A capability might be delivered by:
- A human with the relevant skill
- An automated system
- An AI-assisted tool
- Some combination

This matters more now than it did five years ago. AI agents can augment or replace certain atoms. Automation can shift capabilities from humans to systems. The organism needs to reason about this without assuming all capability lives in people.

**Questions worth asking:**
- Which capabilities can safely be augmented by AI?
- Which require human judgment, empathy, or accountability?
- Where does automation reduce the need for certain atoms?
- Where does automation create new capability requirements (oversight, maintenance, prompt engineering)?
- How does responsibility and oversight change when a capability moves from human to machine?

ATD doesn't answer these questions — they're context-dependent. But it provides a framework for asking them. If you understand your capability requirements at the atom level, you can make deliberate decisions about which atoms should be human, which should be automated, and which should be hybrid.

## The Limits of Design

A final note: ATD provides a lens for intentional design. It doesn't guarantee outcomes.

Organisations are too complex to fully control. People are unpredictable. Markets shift. Technology changes. The best-designed organism can still struggle if the environment changes faster than it can adapt.

What ATD offers is:
- **Visibility** — see your capability landscape clearly
- **Language** — talk about structure and evolution precisely
- **Intentionality** — make deliberate choices rather than drifting

It won't prevent all problems. But it will help you understand your problems and respond to them coherently.

## Practical Questions

**Current state:**
- What is the overall capability landscape of this organisation?
- Where are the concentrations and gaps?
- What are the organism-level single points of failure?
- How well do cells and organs interact?

**Evolution:**
- What capabilities are we building, losing, or transforming?
- Are we recomposing continuously or waiting for reorganisation?
- How is our capability mix shifting with automation and AI?
- Are we designing for where we're going, not just where we are?

**Health:**
- Do we understand our capability requirements, or are we guessing?
- Are small changes easy or does everything feel stuck?
- When something breaks, do we understand why?
- Is the organisation adapting, or just surviving?

## Conclusion

ATD starts with atoms — the fundamental unit of capability — and builds up through molecules, cells, and organs to the organism as a whole.

At each level, the questions are similar:
- What do we need?
- What do we have?
- Where are the gaps?
- How do we evolve?

The answers differ at each level, but the lens is consistent. Understanding capability — where it exists, where it's needed, where it's fragile — is the foundation of intentional organisational design.

The goal isn't to optimise. It's to design deliberately, adapt continuously, and build an organisation that can evolve with its environment.
