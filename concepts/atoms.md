# Atoms

_Understanding capability as the fundamental unit of organisational design_

## What Is an Atom?

In Atomic Team Design, an Atom represents a single capability: a skill, competency, or area of expertise that contributes to meaningful work.

Atoms are the smallest unit the framework concerns itself with. They are not roles, responsibilities, or tasks. They are the building blocks of what an organisation can actually do.

Examples of atoms include:

- A programming language or technical discipline
- A design capability
- A domain or regulatory skill
- An operational or leadership capability

Without a clear understanding of the atoms present within an organisation, and the atoms required by its outcomes, organisational design becomes abstract and imprecise.

## Why Capability Matters More Than Role

Traditional organisational design starts with roles and titles. Atomic Team Design starts with capability.

Roles:

- Bundle many capabilities together
- Change meaning across organisations
- Become outdated faster than the skills they describe

Capabilities:

- Are composable
- Are transferable
- Evolve independently of structure

Two people with the same title may share few meaningful atoms.

Two people with different titles may share many.

Designing around roles hides this reality. Designing around atoms exposes it.

## Atoms Are Contextual and Non-Binary

An atom is not a universal constant.

The same capability can:

- Look different in different contexts
- Require different depth depending on its use
- Be critical in one team and incidental in another

For example, a capability like “risk management” may be:

- Central and specialised in one team
- Lightweight and situational in another
- Embedded within automation elsewhere

Atomic Team Design does not attempt to define a canonical set of atoms. The framework assumes that capability is contextual by nature.

## Subatomic Particles: What Makes an Atom Effective

Capabilities do not exist in isolation or at a single level of depth.

In practice, an atom’s effectiveness is influenced by three factors:

### Foundational Traits

Enduring characteristics that affect how a capability is learned and applied, such as problem-solving ability, adaptability, or empathy.

These traits influence:

- Speed of learning
- Reliability under pressure
- Ability to apply skills in novel situations

### Learned Skills

The concrete knowledge and techniques acquired through education, training, and experience.

These are the most visible part of an atom but not the only one.

### Proficiency

The depth, confidence, and consistency with which a capability can be exercised.

Proficiency is not static. It grows, decays, and shifts as context changes.

Atomic Team Design treats these elements as inseparable. Two people may nominally share the same capability while differing dramatically in how safely or effectively it can be relied upon.

## Atoms Decay, Evolve, and Cluster

Capabilities are not permanent.

Atoms:

- Decay when unused
- Evolve through practice and exposure
- Cluster with adjacent capabilities

Understanding adjacency matters more than exact matching.

For example, a person lacking a specific atom may still be well-positioned to acquire it quickly if they already possess related capabilities. This has significant implications for hiring, learning, and team design.

Atomic Team Design encourages leaders to think in terms of capability neighbourhoods, not isolated skills.

## Ownership, Responsibility, and Capability

An important distinction in Atomic Team Design is that capability does not imply ownership.

A team may:

- Rely on a capability
- Be affected by its absence
- Share responsibility for its outcomes

Without “owning” that capability as a role or function.

This distinction helps avoid:

- Overloading teams with implicit expectations
- Creating artificial silos
- Assuming capability exists simply because responsibility has been assigned

Atoms describe what is possible, not who is accountable.

## Common Misinterpretations

### “Atoms are just skills in a skills matrix”

Skills matrices typically treat skills as:

- Binary
- Static
- Independently measurable

Atoms are:

- Contextual
- Composed
- Interdependent

The difference is not cosmetic; it changes how decisions are made.

### “More atoms is always better”

Capability accumulation without purpose leads to fragility.

Atomic Team Design emphasises fitness to purpose, not maximal coverage. Excess capability can introduce complexity, coordination overhead, and risk.

## Why Atoms Matter in Practice

Thinking in atoms changes how leaders reason about:

- Hiring versus learning
- Team composition
- Structural risk and single points of failure
- Succession and resilience
- The safe introduction of automation and AI

Before changing structure, Atomic Team Design asks a simpler question:

Do we actually have the capabilities required for what we are trying to do?

## How This Fits with the Rest of Atomic Team Design

Atoms are the foundation of the framework.

They combine into Molecules, which form Cells, which together make up the Organism.

Understanding atoms is not an academic exercise - it is the prerequisite for intentional organisational design.
