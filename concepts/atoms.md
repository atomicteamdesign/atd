# Atoms

*Capability as the fundamental unit of organisational design.*

## What Is an Atom?

An atom is a single capability — a skill, competency, or area of expertise that contributes to meaningful work.

Atoms are the smallest unit ATD concerns itself with. They're not roles, responsibilities, or tasks. They're the building blocks of what an organisation can actually do.

Examples:
- A programming language (Kotlin, Python, SQL)
- A technical discipline (system design, observability, security)
- A domain expertise (payments, compliance, onboarding)
- A practice (incident response, user research, technical writing)

Without understanding the atoms you have and the atoms you need, organisational design becomes guesswork.

## Why Capability, Not Role?

Traditional org design starts with roles and titles. ATD starts with capability.

**Roles:**
- Bundle many capabilities together
- Mean different things in different companies
- Become outdated faster than the skills they describe

**Capabilities:**
- Are composable — they combine in different ways
- Are transferable — they move with people
- Evolve independently of org structure

Two people with the same title may share few atoms. Two people with different titles may share many. Designing around roles hides this. Designing around atoms exposes it.

## Atoms Are Contextual

The same capability can look different depending on where it's used.

"Kubernetes" might mean:
- Deep platform expertise in an infrastructure team
- Operational awareness in a product team
- Theoretical knowledge in a consulting role

"Risk management" might be:
- Central and specialised in a compliance function
- Lightweight and situational in a product squad
- Embedded in automation elsewhere

ATD doesn't try to define a universal list of atoms. What matters is understanding the atoms *your* organisation needs, at the depth *your* context requires.

## Proficiency Isn't Binary

Two people can both "know Kotlin" while differing dramatically in what they can safely be trusted to do with it.

Proficiency matters. A useful scale:

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **1 - Learning** | Aware of the topic, actively developing |
| **2 - Applying** | Can use it with guidance, not yet independent |
| **3 - Competent** | Works independently, handles typical problems |
| **4 - Advanced** | Trusted with complex work, supports others |
| **5 - Expert** | Deep expertise, shapes practice, teaches |

This isn't about ranking people. It's about understanding what you can rely on and where the gaps are.

## Atoms Decay and Evolve

Capabilities aren't permanent.

- **Decay**: Unused skills fade. Someone who hasn't written Java in three years isn't the same Java developer they were.
- **Evolution**: Skills grow through practice and exposure. Adjacent capabilities develop together.
- **Clustering**: Atoms don't exist in isolation. Someone strong in React likely has adjacent strength in JavaScript, possibly TypeScript, possibly frontend testing.

This matters for planning. A person missing a specific atom might still be well-positioned to acquire it quickly if they have related capabilities. Understanding adjacency is often more useful than exact matching.

## Capability ≠ Responsibility

An important distinction: having a capability doesn't mean owning it.

A team might:
- Rely on a capability
- Be affected by its absence
- Share responsibility for outcomes that depend on it

Without "owning" that capability as a defined function.

This helps avoid:
- Overloading teams with implicit expectations
- Creating artificial silos
- Assuming capability exists because someone has been assigned responsibility

Atoms describe what's possible, not who's accountable.

## Common Mistakes

### "This is just a skills matrix"

Skills matrices typically treat skills as binary checkboxes, static over time, and independently measurable. Atoms are contextual, composed, and interdependent. The difference changes how you make decisions.

### "More atoms is always better"

Capability accumulation without purpose creates fragility. A team that "can do everything" often can't do anything well. ATD emphasises fitness for purpose, not maximum coverage.

### "We should standardise our atom list"

Some standardisation helps communication. But over-standardising loses the context that makes atoms useful. "Frontend development" as a single atom hides important differences between React, accessibility, and performance optimisation.

## Why This Matters

Thinking in atoms changes how you approach:

- **Hiring**: What capability are we actually missing?
- **Team composition**: Do we have what this work requires?
- **Risk**: Where are we one resignation away from a problem?
- **Learning**: What should we invest in developing?
- **Automation**: Which capabilities could be augmented or replaced?

Before changing structure, ATD asks a simpler question: *Do we actually have the capabilities required for what we're trying to do?*
